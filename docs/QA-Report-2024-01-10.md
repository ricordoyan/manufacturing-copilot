# QA Incident Report — IR-2024-0110-L3

**Date:** 2024-01-10
**Production Line:** Line 3
**Shift:** Night Shift (22:00–06:00)
**Reported By:** James Okafor, QA Inspector
**Severity:** Moderate

## 1. Summary

A moderate increase in edge deformation defects was observed on Production Line 3 between 01:30 and 03:15 on January 10, 2024. The defect rate reached 6.8% at 02:15, compared to the baseline of 1.8–2.3%.

## 2. Defect Description

- **Type:** Edge deformation and minor warping
- **Location on product:** Left and right edges of formed panels
- **Visual characteristics:** Slight curling of panel edges, asymmetric thickness at edges (deviation of 0.3–0.5mm from spec)

## 3. Investigation Findings

### Sensor Data
- Line speed was stable at 45 m/min.
- Forming Zone temperature was within Normal Range (174°C average).
- **Pressure sensor P-3A** recorded a drop from 3.2 bar to 2.4 bar starting at 01:15.
- The hydraulic pressure on the forming press was insufficient to maintain consistent edge forming.

### Root Cause
- Hydraulic pump **HP-03** experienced a partial seal failure, causing a slow pressure loss in the forming press hydraulic circuit.
- The pressure loss was gradual (approximately 0.1 bar per 10 minutes), which delayed detection.

### Contributing Factors
- The pressure drop threshold in SCADA was set at 2.0 bar (Critical), but there was no Warning threshold configured for gradual pressure decline.
- Night shift had reduced maintenance staffing.

## 4. Corrective Actions Taken

1. HP-03 seals replaced on 2024-01-10, 04:30. Pressure restored to 3.3 bar.
2. Affected product (approx. 320 units) quarantined and reworked where possible. 89 units scrapped.
3. Line speed temporarily reduced to 40 m/min during repair.

## 5. Preventive Actions

1. SCADA pressure Warning Threshold added at 2.8 bar for all lines.
2. Hydraulic pump seal inspection added to weekly maintenance checklist.
3. Night shift maintenance coverage under review for adequate staffing levels.
