**Note (2023-09-01):** V-17 calibration was scheduled under WO-3246 but was deferred because the planned Line 3 shutdown (originally Sept 2–3) was rescheduled to Sept 18 due to a customer order deadline. The calibration was to be performed during the shutdown. The incident on Sept 14 occurred before the rescheduled shutdown date.
