# QA Incident Report — IR-2023-0914-L3

**Date:** 2023-09-14
**Production Line:** Line 3
**Shift:** Day Shift (06:00–14:00)
**Reported By:** Maria Chen, QA Inspector
**Severity:** Major

## 1. Summary

An elevated surface defect rate was detected on Production Line 3 between 11:15 and 13:40 on September 14, 2023. The defect rate peaked at 14.2% at 12:30, compared to the baseline rate of 1.8–2.3% for this product.

## 2. Defect Description

- **Type:** Surface cracks and pitting
- **Location on product:** Predominantly on the upper forming surface
- **Visual characteristics:** Hairline cracks oriented perpendicular to the extrusion direction; shallow pitting in clusters of 3–8 marks

## 3. Investigation Findings

### Temperature Data
- Forming Zone temperature began rising at approximately 10:45, crossing the Warning Threshold (185°C) at 11:12.
- Peak temperature recorded: 193°C at 12:15.
- Temperature did not return to Normal Range until 13:55, after maintenance intervention.

### Root Cause
- Cooling valve **V-17** had developed calibration drift of approximately 12%, resulting in the valve delivering only 71% of commanded flow at the 100% position.
- The drift had accumulated over approximately 45 days since the last calibration check (performed on 2023-08-01).
- The reduced coolant flow caused a gradual temperature rise in the Forming Zone, which was not immediately detected because the rise was slow (approximately 1.5°C per 15 minutes) and initially remained within the Normal Range.

### Contributing Factors
- The 30-day calibration interval for V-17 had been missed due to a scheduling conflict with a planned line shutdown.
- The SCADA warning alert was acknowledged by the operator at 11:15 but the escalation to maintenance was delayed by 25 minutes due to a concurrent issue on Line 1.

## 4. Corrective Actions Taken

1. V-17 was recalibrated at 13:20 on 2023-09-14 (flow deviation corrected from 12% to within 2%).
2. Line speed was reduced to 38 m/min (from nominal 45 m/min) during the cooling period.
3. All product manufactured between 11:00 and 14:00 was quarantined for 100% visual inspection. 847 units were scrapped (estimated cost: $12,400).

## 5. Preventive Actions

1. Calibration check frequency for Line 3 cooling valves increased from 30 days to 21 days, effective immediately.
2. SCADA alert escalation rules updated: if Warning Threshold is exceeded for >10 minutes without maintenance acknowledgment, auto-escalate to shift supervisor and on-call engineer.
3. QA to perform trend analysis on Forming Zone temperature data weekly to identify slow drift patterns before they reach Warning Threshold.
