## 1. Production Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Units Produced | 2,847 |
| Target | 3,000 |
| Achievement | 94.9% |
| Defect Rate (Shift Average) | 3.4% |
| Defect Rate (Last Hour) | 5.1% |
| Downtime | 18 minutes (conveyor jam at 09:22, cleared by 09:40) |

## 2. Active Issues Requiring Attention

### Issue 1: Rising Defect Rate (ACTIVE)
- Starting at approximately 13:00, the defect rate on Line 3 began increasing. Surface cracks and minor pitting have been observed.
- Forming Zone temperature has been trending upward: 178°C at 12:00, 182°C at 13:00, 184°C at 13:45.
- Temperature has not yet crossed the Warning Threshold (185°C) but the trend is concerning.
- Cooling valve flow rates appear normal on SCADA, but given the history with V-17 (see IR-2023-0914-L3), I recommend a manual flow check on V-15, V-16, and V-17 early in your shift.
- Line speed has been reduced by 10% to 40.5 m/min as a precaution.
- QA has been notified and is performing increased sampling.

### Issue 2: Conveyor Belt Tracking
- The conveyor belt has been tracking slightly to the left since the belt replacement on 2023-11-05. It has not caused production issues but should be monitored. Maintenance has it on the schedule for adjustment next week.

## 3. Maintenance Activities Completed This Shift
- Routine calibration check on V-15, V-16, V-17 completed at 08:00 (WO-3515). All within spec. V-17 deviation at 1.8%, which is within the 8% limit but higher than the 0.8% recorded on 2023-11-20. Recommend monitoring this trend.

## 4. Materials and Supplies
- Raw material stock sufficient for 2.5 shifts.
- Coolant reservoir at 78% capacity.
- Spare forming dies available in tool crib.

## 5. Safety Notes
- No safety incidents this shift.
- Reminder: wet floor signage needed near cooling station 3 due to minor condensation buildup.
